# K-means-Titanic-dataset
__README__
This Google Colab notebook demonstrates the implementation of k-means clustering using Python and scikit-learn. The notebook includes a step-by-step guide to the process, along with sample code and visualizations.

##Getting Started##
To use this notebook, you will need a Google account and access to Google Colab. Once you have opened the notebook, you can run each cell by clicking the "play" button or pressing Shift+Enter.

##Dependencies##
This notebook requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
These dependencies are included in the Google Colab environment and do not need to be installed separately.

##Contents##
This notebook contains the following sections:

##Introduction:
A brief overview of k-means clustering and its applications.
Data Preparation: Loading and preprocessing the dataset for use in the k-means algorithm.
Model Creation: Implementing the k-means algorithm using scikit-learn.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the k-means algorithm using visualizations and metrics.
Parameter Tuning: Experimenting with different parameter settings to optimize the performance of the k-means algorithm.
